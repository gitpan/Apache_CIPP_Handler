Revision history for Perl extension Apache::CIPP_Handler.

0.07  Tue Jan 26 11:40:00 1999
	- explicit perl syntax check via 'perl -c' removed
	  (this was unnecessary because errors are catched via eval,
	   also this crashed on SuSE 6.0 Linux systems)

0.06  Sun Jan 04 00:00:00 1999
	- debug flag in access.conf

0.05  Sun Dec 14 00:00:00 1998
        - cache is now splitted into subdirectories
        - names of subroutines and cache files are now really
          unique
        - basic support for the HEAD request method
        - if the CIPP program uses <?AUTOPRINT OFF> no HTTP headers
          will be generated by CIPP_Handler. This is then up to the
          CIPP Program.
